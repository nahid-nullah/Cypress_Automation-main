# Cypress_Automation-main
Hello, thank you for reviewing my project. I utilized the Page Object Model Framework
to complete this project using Cypress with JavaScript on Visual Studio Code

NOTE: All Page Object Classes can be found under Cypress_Automation_main/cypress/integration/PageObjects
      There are 7 POM Classes: ArticleHomePage, HomePage, NewPostPage, SettingsPage, SignInPage, SingUpPage, and WebPage

NOTE: Test Class is located under Cypress_Automation_main/cypress/integration/specs
      The Test Class is named 'TakeHome'

NOTE: To run the script, go to terminal and enter the following command: npm run takehometest
